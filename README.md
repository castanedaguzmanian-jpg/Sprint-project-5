In this project, I worked as a data analyst for Megaline, a telecommunications company that offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate.
The objective was to determine which plan generates higher revenue in order to support marketing budget allocation decisions.
The analysis was based on a dataset of 500 Megaline customers, including demographic information, plan type, number of calls made, text messages sent, and usage data throughout 2018.
The project involved:
Analyzing customer behavior across both prepaid plans.
Aggregating usage metrics (calls, messages, and plan-related activity).
Calculating monthly and total revenue per plan.
Comparing revenue performance between Surf and Ultimate to identify the more profitable option.
This preliminary analysis provides actionable insights into customer usage patterns and revenue generation, helping the business make data-driven decisions regarding advertising and plan promotion strategies.
Tools used: Python (pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook
